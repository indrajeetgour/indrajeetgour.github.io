Come straight to the point, how to alter the default editor from MobaXterm to which ever you want.

## How to make changes
Do follow the following steps:
- Go to the "Setting --> Configuration"
- You will have this popup 

![How to alter default editor](https://github.com/indrajeetgour/indrajeetgour.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/mobaxterm.png)

Click on to the highlighted seletion mentioned.

You will have another popup coming up(`this will let you select your choice of editor`), just round to the installation directory of that software.

I love to work with sublime text, so I selected its exe from the installation directory.

Let me know if you had any issue doing this. CHEERS!!
