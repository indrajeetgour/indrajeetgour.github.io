Being a *Data Engineer& I had to work a lot with databases. Over the time my best tool of choice is `SQL Workbench/j` as it is open source, fast and free.

I recently had to change my laptop due to some issue with my display, so I need to shift my entire deskspace from my laptopn to another and as I mentioned SQL workbench is not go to solution for this I had to made that shift from old PC to new one.

I did have google for this, sharing the best and easy solution I found.

Your client default location for sotring all the setting would be at __*C:\Users\YOUR-USER\\.sqlworkbench*__

What you need to do this, just copy all the containt from mentioned dir into your new workstation directory. I my case it looks likr this:

![sql-workbeachj-config-dir](../assets/images/sql-workbeachj-config-dir.png)

For more information about each file inside [refer this link](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/manual/install.html#config-dir)
